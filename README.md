[GazeDeploy](https://github.com/phuselab/GazeDeploy) (kinda), but using Reinforcement Learning.

## Running the code

The code uses `python 3.11.7`. To run it, do the following:

1. Get the data from phuselab's SFTP server.
    1. (optional) Spin up a virtual environment.
2. Install all the requirements (i.e, `pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Run `extract_frames.py`
4. Pick the Jupyter notebook that most interests you and have fun!
